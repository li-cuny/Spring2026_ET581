## Step 3: Take a Screenshot of the Output

> Codespaces runs in a **web browser**, so screenshots are taken using your computer.

### Windows
- Press **Windows + Shift + S**
- Select the area showing the terminal output
- Paste into **Paint** or **Photos** and save the image

### Mac
- Press **Command + Shift + 4**
- Drag to select the terminal output
- Screenshot is automatically saved to the **Desktop**

Make sure the screenshot clearly shows:
- Program output
- No compilation or runtime errors

## Step 4: Download Java Files from Codespaces

1. In the **Explorer** panel in Codespaces, locate your `.java` files.
2. Right-click each required `.java` file.
3. Select **Download**.
4. The files will be downloaded to your local computer.

## Step 5: Create Homework Folder on Your Local Computer

1. On your computer (Desktop or Documents):
   - Right-click → **New Folder**
2. Name the folder using the required format, for example:
   ```
   hw1_yourname
   ```
3. Move all downloaded `.java` files into this folder.
4. Move the output screenshot image into the same folder.

Your folder should now contain:
- `.java` files
- Screenshot(s) of output

## Step 6: Zip the Homework Folder (Local Computer)

### Windows
1. Right-click the `hw1_yourname` folder.
2. Select **Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder**.
3. A file named `hw1_yourname.zip` will be created.

### Mac
1. Right-click the `hw1_yourname` folder.
2. Select **Compress “hw1_yourname”**.
3. A file named `hw1_yourname.zip` will be created.
